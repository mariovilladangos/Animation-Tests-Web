# Animation Tests Web
This website is going to act as a one place stand for all the 
css animations I make. The main goal is to increase and 
improve my skills on html, css and javascript.

## Tryout the website
The website right now is very precarious, not finished yet
and probably won't ever be, since there's always space for 
improvement and more animations.
